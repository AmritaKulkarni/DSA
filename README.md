# Data Structures and Algorithms

This project encapsulates the work of Amrita Kulkarni in practising DSA problems. The subtopics and related problems are captured as follows :

## 1) Arrays

-> ProductMax.cpp : Find two integers in an array that produce the largest result

-> MinSubArrayK.cpp : Find a subarray of size K that gives the minimum sum

-> Wave.cpp : Sort an array such that the elements create a wave pattern

-> Duplicates : Print out elements in an array that are duplicated

## 2) Stacks

-> DynamicStack.cpp : Implement a dynamically growing stack

-> NGE.cpp : Find the next greater element in an array

-> stackReversal.cpp : Reverse a stack using recursion

-> stackSorting.cpp : Sort a stack using recursion
